# 0 C.E.

### *Build an empire, forge alliances, and conquer the ancient world.*

## About the Game

**0 C.E.** is a web-based, open-source strategy game set in the ancient world, inspired by classics like *Grepolis* and *0 A.D.* Players start with a single city and work to expand their territory, amass resources, build powerful armies, and form alliances with others. The ultimate goal: to dominate the world through strategy, diplomacy, and battle.

As an ongoing project, **0 C.E.** aims to provide a deep, historical strategy experience where players explore various ancient civilizations, manage their cities, engage in large-scale battles, and collaborate or compete with others in a persistent online world.

## Current Features

- **World Map**: Explore a vast world map, locate your city, and plan your expansion.
- **City Building**: Establish and develop your city to gain resources, strengthen defenses, and grow your population.
- **Basic Combat**: Engage in battles to defend your city and conquer others.
  
Planned features include more civilizations, advanced combat mechanics, alliance management, trading, and more.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using:

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Python Flask, MariaDB
- **Real-Time Communication**: Planned support for WebSockets or Socket.IO
- **Deployment and Development**: Docker

Future improvements will bring additional gameplay features and optimizations as the game evolves.
